## 📋 Required CSV Columns

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `client_name` | Customer name | John Doe |
| `agent` | Agent ID or Name | AG-001 |
| `yacht` | Yacht ID or Name | YT-001 |
| `paid_amount` | Final amount paid | 850.00 |
| Package cols | ch, ad, vip_ad, etc. | 2, 4, 1 |

## 🎯 Quick Calculation Example

**Given:**
- Agent discount: 15%
- CHILD × 2 @ AED 100 = AED 200
- ADULT × 4 @ AED 150 = AED 600

**Calculate:**
```
Base:     200 + 600 = 800
Discount: 800 × 15% = 120
Expected: 800 - 120 = 680
```

**CSV must show:** `paid_amount: 680.00`
